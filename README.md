20/12/24 â€” Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening po, Sir Reymar. Excuse me po and I apologize for submitting my output through a docx file, google drive link. I am unable to upload po the folder dito kasi sabi "Committing the files to the repository failed. The file is too large and cannot be uploaded. Consider creating the file in a local clone and pushing it to GitHub." whenever I try to upload it, when it's around 53mb lang naman. I'm sorry again po and hoping for your kind consideration(s). Thank you sir, in advance!
